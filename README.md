## Background

The components and style guide of the FSA Design System follow industry-standard web accessibility guidelines and use the best practices of existing style libraries and modern web design.

It was created and maintained by the USA-FSA Office of Architecture, and is heavily influenced by the [Draft U.S. Web Design Standards](https://standards.usa.gov/) created and maintained by the wonderful folks at [18F](https://18f.gsa.gov/).

They are designed for use by FSA product teams who want to create beautiful, easy-to-use online experiences.

## Reuse of open-source style guides

This Design System was initially based on the [Draft U.S. Web Design Standards](https://playbook.cio.gov/designstandards/) created and maintained by the [U.S. Digital Service](https://www.whitehouse.gov/digital/united-states-digital-service) and [18F](https://18f.gsa.gov/) designers and developers. The Draft U.S. Web Design Standards are designed for use by government product teams who want to create beautiful, easy-to-use online experiences for the public.
